# ServletApplication

This application uses the doGet() method and HTTP response object to set up a generic registration page with fields such Name, Gender, Country, 
Languages spoken. I used HTTP servlets to handle this. I also created a couple classes to teach myself how to read/set HTTP headers and status
code.
